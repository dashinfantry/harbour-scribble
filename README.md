# harbour-scribble
Scribble is a fast and lightweight app for hand drawings and sketches.

 It offers some tweaks like painting on background images, adjusting colors / strokewidth or two-finger clicks for straight lines. You may even disable system gestures, if they get in your way while drawing. A small lock symbol reminds you to re-enable them in order to close the app later.
 
 I'm a taking over from the original: https://openrepos.net/content/planetosstore/scribble It will remain available there.
